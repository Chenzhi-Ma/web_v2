## Purpose 
This project will quantify the economic impact of alternative, performance-based designs for structural 
performance in fire of composite steel-framed buildings. Experiments at the NIST NFRL are supporting the development 
of new methods to quantify the structural performance in fire, however, wide adoption for design of these engineering 
methods in lieu of the current prescriptive fire protection rules require economic data to highlight possible benefits. 
By providing cost assessment and evaluation of case studies to complement forthcoming design methods, the project 
will contribute to support new provisions in building codes for a more efficient use of resources in the U.S. construction industry.
